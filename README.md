# Peoject_sunrise

The project sunrise was undertaken by the direction of [24]7.ai, Bangalore. The company provided five projects for the Department of Computer Applications, PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore. The mentor of the project sunrise advised to work on each project considering team size of six students and two per approach. Since this was considered as Mini project for the academic course, each project is taken by the students of team size two considering one approach.

Purpose of the Project:
The purpose of the project is to make an intelligent keyboard to anticipate the following character in a word and next word in a sentence. The system ought to have the option to auto-complete the word and the sentence meaningfully. It is based on the probability distribution. During the training word sequences are not observed. It is mostly based on the assumption that the probability of a word that depends on the previous “n” number of words.
